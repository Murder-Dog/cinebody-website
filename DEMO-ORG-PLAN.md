# Demo Org — Altitude Athletics (SEEDED Aug 22)

**Status: DONE.** The demo brand is live and every scriptable tour screenshot has been re-captured from it. What's left is Scott's camera work (below).

## The brand
**Altitude Athletics** — Denver strength & conditioning studio, "Train higher." Two locations (RiNo + Wash Park). Colors: Ignition Orange #FF5A2D / Carbon #14181D / Bone #EFEAE3. Logo (twin peaks + elevation ticks) lives in R2, mark-only icon set as org logo.

- **Org id:** `3615081c-c5c3-4ae5-9a5c-b23e17f850cc` (scott@cinebody.com is admin; switch orgs from the sidebar)
- Brand Kit fully filled: profile, voice, audience, filming rules, colors, logo.

## What's in it
- **4 projects via the REAL wizard** (shot lists genuinely AI-generated):
  - Fall Strength Block Launch (Open, flat $150/filmer, funded) `c2e1eaa3`
  - Member Stories (Guided, 2 interview shots, flat $75, deliberately NOT funded — payouts page shows the "Fund" nudge) `abf87fa5`
  - RiNo Open Gym Night (Open, $40/clip bounty, funded) `96954a11`
  - Always-On Social (Open, $25/clip bounty, funded) `2effa45d`
- **28 stock clips** (Pexels, free commercial) uploaded through the real filmer APIs → R2 → Mux → prod webhook ran real AI review + thumbnails. Every clip geotagged (Denver spread + Boulder/Austin/Santa Monica) so maps fill.
- **Reviews curated** to an honest-healthy spread: 10 great / 12 good / 4 redo (kept the genuine strict reviews) / 2 rejected.
- **10 filmer personas** with profiles; 6 marked Stripe-connected. 17 transactions ($75–$225 lifetime each), mix of available/pending → Payouts page shows $200 pending approval, $3,750 funded remaining.
- **2 real AI rough cuts** saved: "Open Gym Night Recap" (Reels 30s), "Fall Block Launch Teaser" (TikTok 27s).
- **Messages:** believable Chris Delgado thread on Open Gym Night + a targeted Direction + a broadcast Direction on Launch.
- **Idea Studio:** 6 real AI-generated on-brand ideas ("Last Rep at 5,280", "Coach, One Cue"...).

## Captures (all same filenames, site untouched)
- All 12 referenced desk-*.jpg re-captured (1800px), plus phone-filmer.jpg and the unreferenced extras.
- App shots via sim + Appium: app-pulse, app-projects, app-project, app-library.
- Verified rendering on /platform in Chrome — no broken images.

## Left for Scott (real phone, real filming)
- **app-camera-2.jpg** (shot brief over live camera) and **app-hud-idle.jpg** (live checks HUD) — open the app, switch to Altitude Athletics, film in RiNo Open Gym Night.
- Interview capture shots if wanted (Member Stories has 2 interview shots configured).
- Filmer links for phone testing (append token path to prod or LAN dev URL):
  - Chris Delgado / Open Gym Night: `/s/adf2e57a45b519f9703a85cf7291b8229f454fe058952bc7391cb6ff61c64f03`
  - Maya Torres / Launch: `/s/8d1414ad9f00efd92217bda77c67873888e6c31e0d4179ee581c4564836a2c88`
  - Dana Brooks / Member Stories (interview): `/s/5a916f62e3051d549dabdfc8e4a17a7df0ff4994dbd12630e2f2de46bc8e37bc`
- Optional later: replace stock clips with real Altitude-style footage (stock-first-replace-later was the call).

## Notes
- Web captures ran on localhost:3001 (`npx next dev -p 3001` in apps/web), login scott@cinebody.com / Cinebody2026!, then POST /api/org/switch — every fresh Playwright profile MUST switch or you're in the dev Cinebody org.
- Sim recipe: Metro `npx expo start --dev-client --port 8082` (app.json runtimeVersion temporarily "1.0.0", REVERTED after), Appium started with cwd = the scratchpad that has appium-xcuitest-driver in node_modules (home autodetects from cwd).
- Scott's personal filmer card on Pulse still shows his dev filmer stats (relinking his user row was out of bounds); it appears in desk-pulse.jpg like it did before.
- Old bug from last session: PEXELS_API_KEY still missing on Vercel; clips were scraped via headed Chrome instead (Cloudflare blocks headless).

## Addendum (same day, later)
- Every tour section now has a phone frame: app-messages (same Chris thread), app-brandkit, app-cut (real frame from the Open Gym Night cut's footage), plus refreshed app-earnings.
- Payments story deepened: Jordan Reyes ($190) and Marcus Lee ($80) cashed out (completed cashouts scoped to their shoots) — web Payouts shows Total Paid $270; Maya kept at $200 available for the app Cash Out screen.
- scott@cinebody.com users.filmer_profile_id was temporarily pointed at Maya Torres' demo profile (d45e0e9b-70a2-4560-9258-83b6853a6481) for the app My Earnings capture, then RESTORED to the original bd06de0c-682e-4023-b5c5-0d24c0ce0776. The sim app was switched back to the Cinebody org. The Pulse filmer card pools ALL clips under the email (174 dev QA clips, 3.5 avg), so it was hidden for the desk-pulse capture by nulling the field during that one shot. To re-shoot app earnings later, relink Maya first.
